Why hasn't Elon put up some some of his own private money to help end homelessness? Because homelessness is not a money problem. Almost every single one of them has either mental problems or drug disorders. It is not a matter of lack of capital. It's that they should either be in an asylum or they're doing hard drugs and they don't want to stop.
We have homeless that the asylums that Ronald Reagan defunded.
