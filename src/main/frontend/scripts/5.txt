Is actually I think not bias in the algorithm, but bias in media.
The overwhelming majority of media is cleaning. There's many more sites potentially putting out Proharis articles and there are putting out pro.
Trump articles which can start to overweight the algorithm.
As you know there are so many more liberal journalists and there's so many more liberal media outlets out there 1, at least it's probably 20 to 1 the general news.
Media bias is what you're actually seeing versus a Google bias there needs to be more investment in journalists by Republicans.
The number of people in journalism, this is from 1971 to 2022, who say they are identifying as Republican, has just absolutely plummeted.
That's incredible that's a good chart.
Jakell I know this and this is what I'm trying to explain to you.
Sach an incredible opportunity for your party, since you're passionate about this, is to invest in more journalism invest in more journalists because the gap is 30 percent now between people who say they're Democrats and people who say they're Republican in journalism that is a key piece to this problem and layered on top of it I agree with you that Google is filled with liberal people and I agree with you, Chama, that they need to intervene and put at the top of the search results and news this is what we're indexing the percentage that's left leaning this is the percentage that's right leaning and that's something that Google could do that's very unique and that could move the whole country forward. They could showcase that you're saying is they could showcase that up top.
So to my friends at Google who are listening, do a better job of just being more transparent so we don't have this tension in society.
The issue is actually, I think not bias.
